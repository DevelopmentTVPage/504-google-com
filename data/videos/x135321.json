The BMW M6 is also a flagship for the BMW and represents the most power and technology the German Car maker can cram into a sports car. Both cars are very similar in many important ways. They both have two doors, two turbos and four seats. The both have dual clutch transmissions and they both both have superb engines that produce over 500 HP. But the while the M5 uses a roaring V8 the Nissan GT-R makes do with a hand-built  six cylinder. So which of these monster machines is faster to 60 MPH and which one is the better car. Check out another fun and informative TFLcar video Mashup video review as we find out."
