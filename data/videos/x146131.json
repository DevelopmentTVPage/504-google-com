WE really needed 2 large carriers because we live in Los Angeles, in a fire danger, mud slide area (and of course earthquakes) We had lent ours to a friend and we never got them back.  We needed two large ones for Merlin and Yogi, who are over 20 lbs. \n\nTHANK YOU PETCO!!!! \nhttp:\/\/www.petco.com\/\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Petco\n\nWe were sooooo excited to receive $25 dollar gift cards. That was so amazing (and SURPRISING) we went on www.petco.com and priced the different carriers. We saw that we could afford 3 of the 400 series and the carriers were on sale with free shipping! We ordered them and they arrived 4 days later. We feel so much safer knowing we have good carriers and supplies for all the cats.\n\nWe keep about a months worth of cat food, plus other supplies. We are going to include a list here from\n\nhttp:\/\/www.aspca.org\/pet-care\/disaster-preparedness\/\nBasic Emergency Supplies \/ Traveling Kit \n3-7 days' worth of  food\nDisposable litter trays (aluminum roasting pans are perfect)\nLitter or paper toweling\nLiquid dish soap and disinfectant\nDisposable garbage bags for clean-up\nPet feeding dishes\nBottled watertwo\nA traveling bag, crate or sturdy carrier, ideally one for each pet\nFlashlight\nBlanket (for scooping up a fearful pet)\nEspecially for cats: Pillowcase or EvackSack, toys, scoopable litter\n\nKitties; Merlin, Fairy Princess, Elfin, Buddha and Yogi.  \n\nFurball Fables\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/Furballfables\n\ntwitter\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/furballcats\n\nFacebook\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/furballfables.cats\n\nFurball Pet Friends\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/FurballPetFriends\n\nMusic - Malt Shop Bop\nArtist -  Kevin MacLeod\nhttp:\/\/incompetech.com",
