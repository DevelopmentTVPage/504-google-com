When a parent returns from fishing, it leads its twins on a comical steeplechase - sadly there's only enough for one so the winner gets the meal...Two months later and the chicks are fully feathered apart from downy Mohican hairdos - they're ready to take their first swim... reluctantly - it seems penguins are not born with a love of water! And with good reason - a leopard seal explodes from the sea and pulls one from an ice floe - a hunting maneuver that has never been filmed before. As winter approaches, and everyone has left, the giant Emperor penguin arrives and makes an epic trek inland to breed. The mothers soon return to the sea leaving the fathers to hold the eggs and endure the coldest winter on earth."
