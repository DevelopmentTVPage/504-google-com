If you are cooking on a colder or windy day, use a Power Level on the higher side of the temperature range. Setting the correct Power Level isn't an exact science and is part of the fun of outdoor cooking.  If you find your food is cooking faster or slower than you like, simply adjust the power level accordingly. \n\nTo set the power level, press and hold either the (+) or (-) Temperature Control Button for 2 seconds to scroll rapidly through the temperatures. \n\nYou can also step through the power levels slowly by just pressing once to advance power levels higher or lower.\n\nBUY NOW:\nhttp:\/\/www.charbroil.com\/the-big-easyr-2-in-1-electric-smoker-roaster-11101625-a1.html\nCHAR-BROIL LIVE COMMUNITY SITE:\nhttp:\/\/live.charbroil.com\nFACEBOOK: \nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/charbroil\nTWITTER:\nhttp:\/\/www.twitter.com\/charbroil\nSHOP CHAR-BROIL\nhttp:\/\/www.charbroil.com"
