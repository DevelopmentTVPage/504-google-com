    "transcripts": "yeah\n\nme too\n\n\nwhat's up everybody super deluxe fan\nhere for another car review this is of\n\n\ncourse the 2017 subaru WRX premium huge\nthanks to Chris for allowing me to drive\n\n\nhis brand-new Derek's here to review for\nyou guys today\n\n\nso about the 27 WX well I you know much\nlike the 2015 our view\n\n\nnot a whole lot of change but a few\nthings have changed i thought it was\n\n\nworth reviewing again but exterior why's\nit looks identical to the 2015 they\n\n\nhaven't changed anything in that regard\n\n\naside from these wheels now which are\nstandard 18-inch wheels on all models\n\n\nversus the 17 inches on the previous\nmodels and then of course his looks a\n\n\nlittle bit shorter because he attended\nthe corner lights there and the reverse\n\n\npart of the tail lights as well as the\nside windows but I really looks great in\n\n\nWorld Rally blue still my favorite color\nfor these and i still love the way these\n\n\nlook I mean really sharp there you know\ni love those headlines i love the large\n\n\nhood scoop they're nice to have the fog\nlights on the premium\n\n\nI love the wide-body look here of the\nfront fenders and the rear fenders even\n\n\nand you have a nice little vent there in\nthe front fender with the durex emblem\n\n\nand overall I just look really great i\nlove you know the side skirts and\n\n\neverything I mean it from every angle\nunderstanding is the best looking for X\n\n\nsince the point to be honestly and I\nthink it looks great\n\n\nfirst for the interior of the 20 17 WX\nwell it's a really great improvement\n\n\nover the previous generation of course I\nalready talked about that in my 2015\n\n\nreview but I still just love it and they\nhave made a few nice new improvements\n\n\nhere for 2017\n\n\nanyway first things first seeing down\nthese seats they're tighter than I\n\n\nremember them being in the 2015 so\nwhether they improve them slightly or\n\n\nwhatever the torso support seems a\nlittle bit tighter than that before and\n\n\njust they feel really good actually i\nmean the five support could be a little\n\n\nbit more sporty but I get this\n\n\nthe decks is more of a daily driver\ncomfortable one if you want the hardcore\n\n\none you can get the STI and then\ncomplain about having sporty seats but\n\n\nthis actually I think fit the day breaks\nvery well next though is the steering\n\n\nwheel in the decks which I love these\n2015 and up had ever experienced by far\n\n\nthe best part of this interior in my\nopinion\n\n\nI mean it's a perfect wheel really i\nmean just an amazing 93 group that's\n\n\nsuper comfortable it is really cool\ntattoo nauseous and come out really far\n\n\nand it's just a beautiful thing to look\nat me flat bottom and you know there's a\n\n\ngood about a button here on the left\nhand side\n\n\nand the material is still the plastic\nfeels ok we're on the bottom here it\n\n\nlooks like metal but as you can hear I\nstill very much plastic\n\n\nI'm still a little things you know just\nminor but overall I absolutely adore\n\n\nthis wheel and its really nice to use\ngauges in the direction again same as\n\n\nthe 2015 model\n\n\nstill I love them they are still really\nawesome at yeah i love the metal accents\n\n\non the red backlighting i just i love\nthe new phone and the way they look\n\n\nthey're just so much more attracted so\nmuch higher quality looking than the\n\n\nprevious gen again and nice color screen\nthere in the middle that isn't really\n\n\nconfigurable but that's okay because\ncoming over the center here you'll first\n\n\nsee this screen up top that has a boost\ngauge but it also has your you know your\n\n\nfuel economy information torque split\nall that kind of stuff up there you also\n\n\nhave a little display for your automatic\nclimate control which is nice to have\n\n\nthat up there\n\n\none cool thing is on the 2015 the back\nup camera was in this little screen up\n\n\nhere but now let's move down to a larger\nscreen in the main head unit here which\n\n\nis much appreciated as a larger screen\nand that's another operator for 2017\n\n\nnow I its touch screen is standard it's\na six point three inch touchscreen\n\n\nthey're saying here and it's a nice base\nsize of the biggest out there but you\n\n\ncan upgrade to a 7-inch touchscreen and\nif you get me one of the nicer packages\n\n\nbut I mean it's just great to get rid of\nthat finally got rid of that old\n\n\nfashioned basic little radio and now you\nhave an actual touch screen and all\n\n\nmodels which is a really enticing thing\nthat you know you don't have to get the\n\n\nlimited to get a nice one anymore and so\nthat's really great up just a basic\n\n\nthing with us have satellite radio HD\nradio all the standard Bluetooth audio\n\n\nstreaming all that kind of good stuff\nand so nice to have that on there it's a\n\n\nreally nice little screen\n\n\nI coming down to the climate control\nknobs again same great thing as the 2015\n\n\njust really beautiful i love the metal\nfinish here in the way that feels very\n\n\nnice resistance him and overall really\nnice to use one other thing to note is\n\n\nyou might remember from the 2015 ones\n\n\nthis whole centerpiece here is was used\nto be carbon fiber trim and now it's\n\n\njust this gloss black\n\n\nso just taking a little change their\neveryone will prefer one or the other\n\n\nbut nice to see that they've kind of\nhave made that looks a little bit more\n\n\nclassy I think x couple other small\nlittle changes they made 420 sometimes\n\n\nthose\n\n\nnow on ax up down\n\n\nafter the passenger side window as well\nas of course the driver side always had\n\n\nyou also have a nicer headliner here\n\n\nthat is a you know nice and dark and I\nguess\n\n\nsupposedly feels nicer than the one\nbefore it I'm it's still not like\n\n\namazing but hey if it's an improvement\nthat's good to hear\n\n\nalso the shifter in the Denver exercise\nis really great again same isn't it\n\n\nwasn't 2015 longer throws arms but it's\nnice and machi and feels very precise\n\n\nand still very easy to use\n\n\nalthough the clocks throw is a little\nbit on a little bit strange about talk\n\n\nmore about that as we drive for storage\nspace the barracks again same as the\n\n\n2015 very good\n\n\nyou have a map or get here in the door\nwith a bottle holder coming over the\n\n\ncenter here you have a very nice deep\ncopying for all kinds of stuff in it\n\n\nonly has a power outlet i wish there was\nno USB jack or something else up here\n\n\nbut all it is just the old-fashioned\npower outlet there but still nice to\n\n\nhave it unless you have a little\nkeyboard type thing here and then you\n\n\nhave your two cup holders name of the\ncenter armrest which is really the only\n\n\npart about this new direction feels\ncheap to me the truly feels cheap I mean\n\n\nthis is the same arm rest and center\nconsole here out of my 2006 legacy GT\n\n\nlike they haven't changed this in 11\nyears now it's still just the same thing\n\n\nit's hard\n\n\nbarely rubberized and not padded all its\nloose and feels cheap\n\n\nit does have this armrest extension\nwhich is nicer you know for long trips\n\n\nyou can extend it out but just I mean\nthat is really just not fitting for the\n\n\nrest of this car and that might be an\noption because maybe this has the arm\n\n\nextension of the standard ones don't\nhave this or the nicer trims fix that\n\n\nbut on this one in particular just\nsomething that stands out as a sort .\n\n\nthey open it up and you know it's really\ndeep you can fit going to have things in\n\n\nthere and you also have an auxiliary\njack USB jack and another power outlet\n\n\nin their back seat space in the number X\nis pretty good again same as 2015 of\n\n\ncourse I'm 549 be sitting behind myself\nplenty of leg room there are several\n\n\ninches to spare\n\n\nlots and lots of headroom of course\nthanks to the boxy design and they're\n\n\nfairly comfortable seats not the most\namazing you know for a four-door sedan\n\n\nbut they're comfortable and like I said\nthe roomie which is the important thing\n\n\nrackspace the durex is also a little\nunderwhelming given the segment you know\n\n\nthere are some at larger trunks in this\nclass\n\n\nbut it's good enough you know for you to\nbring home the groceries are going on\n\n\nnot small trips things like that i know\nthe lack of a hatch is still a sore spot\n\n\namong superfans\n\n\nI don't know why they haven't introduced\none when they will but in the meantime\n\n\nthat's what you have to make do with\nunfortunately I you would have more\n\n\nspace of course with the hatch if they\ndid make one but it's still a pretty\n\n\nusable trunk so sorry for going for a\ndrive\n\n\nthe premiums here still have the basic\nyou have to get a limited and then get\n\n\nan option package in order to get the\nkeyless entry and push button start but\n\n\nthis is still no sign\n\n\nso you just put the key in the lock\nstart turning up\n\n\nall right setting off in the 2017 subaru\nWRX premium\n\n\nso first thing that you notice there's\nsomething behind here anyway you have a\n\n\nthing that is no is like I said the\nclutch is a very long and it's\n\n\nthroughout the shifter is also very long\nand it's through\n\n\nso that's a whole\n\n\nlong i would say in precise with just\nnot quite sports car like but setting\n\n\noff here and the visibility is always\nspectacular in these a new direction\n\n\nespecially I mean an enormous windshield\nyou can see a very well very thin a\n\n\npillow it's easy to see around side\nglass is all very large easy to see you\n\n\naround the pillar is nice and thin I\nmean servers are excellent you know\n\n\ntheir safety and whatnot and this for\nyou can see out of very well there's all\n\n\nkinds of safety check available and even\nmore safety check if you get the CD\n\n\nversion on\n\n\nso while but yeah I mean really great\nvisibility wise their rear visibility is\n\n\nalso excellent as well so no complaints\nthere and just cruising on a little park\n\n\nroad here they actually newly paved a\nnice and smooth\n\n\nthat you can tell just how nice I does\nabsorb\n\n\nprofessions and things like that and\nthen that's one thing with actually 2016\n\n\nmodel is the premium and limited trims\n\n\nI've got a slightly softer and more\ncomfortable suspension the 2015 models\n\n\nand so those changes also carry over\nhere for 2017\n\n\nso that is one thing i will be trying to\npay attention to is how the suspension\n\n\nfeels compared to the 2015 that I review\n\n\nalright so let's turn out of this\nbackground here see\n\n\nok what the\n\n\nbesides building is a nameless axle-back\nthat's all is just an axle back then and\n\n\nit sounds\n\n\ncool with me\n\n\npractical the upset\n\n\ndid not expect that the power is green\nwe got 268 horsepower and 258 pound-feet\n\n\nof torque here with the 2017 directs a\nvis the 2015\n\n\npowers or 60s 5.4 seconds\n\n\npower for girls only weighs about 3300\n\n\nyou\n\n\n- the power to have fun hey every time I\nget into one of these\n\n\noh I do wish you had more power and\ndifferent\n\n\nlet me also\n\n\nquite as Extreme as the previous\ngeneration of X because of the way the\n\n\nboost\n\n\nmore gradually now than it did in the\nprevious versions with this now i will\n\n\ndrop down here to about 2,200 rpms and\nstop on it and you just ride this wave\n\n\nof toward manages explodes and it just\nreally feels awesome\n\n\ndad just riding the wave of torque and\nany gear is just really satisfying in\n\n\nthat\n\n\nvery slowly with small your faces - so\nmuch fun of my nose\n\n\nthat's fine\n\n\nit is\n\n\nit won't be a star\n\n\nsee how it handles in tighter corners\nreally tight corners here now and this\n\n\nis where it's in the delegate this is\nreally great and now is we're going to\n\n\ndeal with the time for here\n\n\nthese brakes they're not the most\namazing that\n\n\nthis confidence i think a lot of\nbusiness there's a lot\n\n\nthat travel there and once you get into\nthe break that hold feels pretty good\n\n\nsome tight so here now right matching\nand stuff isn't the easiest again\n\n\nbecause that did that broader responses\nmy local channels\n\n\nI kind of have a little bit of that\n\n\nOh\n\n\nactive\n\n\nand then\n\n\nthe handle great\n\n\nand you know\n\n\nit's just beginning just landed\n\n\nthere's this\n\n\njust one\n\n\nquality about these\n\n\nand the other competition you know the\n\n\nI'll Drive stuff out there and it's\nsomething\n\n\nmore expensive alternative stuff\n\n\nand then just really fun\n\n\none thing I will say is that\n\n\nmention that simply talking at once very\nwell so that\n\n\nthat's what it is\n\n\nyour suspension here doesn't seem to\nreally company sacrifice it doesn't seem\n\n\nlonely really it doesn't see\n\n\nas far as the suspension is concerned\neverything's really one down\n\n\nand I really good actually staring\nweight is really nice and not very happy\n\n\nfeeling doesn't have a lot of\n\n\nwhatever you're going to coordinate the\nwhole association with\n\n\nthose are doing\n\n\nbut you kind of just . shit and you will\ndrive and everything it just figures it\n\n\nout and you just you can solve this .\nshooting it does whatever you want to do\n\n\nreally\n\n\nbut like I said that\n\n\nto tell the feedback to the students\n\n\nsounds good\n\n\nI think the way that I can summarize\n\n\nlittle bit disconnected feeling\n\n\nvery much\n\n\nwhat is wrong I don't think of the\nprevious interactions with us handle as\n\n\nwell as the previous oversee their this\nis more akin to the evil handling which\n\n\nis always better than\n\n\nSTI my opinion and the decks of course\nand so I feel like this has that same\n\n\ngood sharp handling that\n\n\nI've been almost and it feels a lot like\nan audi s4 honestly as far as how you\n\n\npersonal stuff\n\n\nbut it's one\n\n\non and just\n\n\nsnakes still\n\n\ngoing out here based on probably the new\nimpressive we just saw recently\n\n\nyou will get to pick it up\n\n\nmuch and that you know make it faster\n\n\nthe sharper\n\n\nare you know things like the civic SI\nhas razor-sharp throttle response\n\n\nother cars out there then\n\n\nget a little more connected to the dr\n\n\nthis price range so there's not many\nthat will put a smile on your face like\n\n\nthis and so yeah\n\n\nto say is you know this car is don't\nhave fun rival the researcher\n\n\ncompetition where is all the competition\nis from google drive\n\n\nwhich have you know makes it feel much\ndifferent and handling and acceleration\n\n\nstuff like the Focus ST and volkswagen\nGTI\n\n\nand so\n\n\nno I don't really know if there's\nanything\n\n\nthe whole drag competition in this car\nstill it's kind of one of the\n\n\nand if you want an all wheel drive car\nunder 30,000 box that will put a smile\n\n\non your face every day\n\n\nthis is no really your only option you\nif you want\n\n\neverything and\n\n\nreally really tough to be honestly I\nmean if you have more money to spend\n\n\nsure you know you can get the st i'm on\n\n\npolice arrest you can get stuff like\nthat but this is still such a phenomenal\n\n\nMorgan\n\n\nany and it sounds great especially this\n\n\nit gives me\n\n\nI'm gonna need is a lot of people\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\nmore excited\n\n\npersonally though even though i wish it\nwas\n\n\nsharper and\n\n\ndays I think that it fills a ton of fun\nof me my pic if I wanted\n\n\nfor more\n\n\nwe'll drive why i said and i think this\nwould do\n\n\nprobably the only thing to choose\nbecause the STI was really fun and daily\n\n\ndriving can be a little stiff for some\nand this gets much better feeling\n\n\non me and it's at you got the newer\nengine technology with the f a 20 year\n\n\nversus the old ej of the STI\n\n\nand so for those reasons I still\nactually the guy prefer this\n\n\nyou know it's so much cheaper than the\nSD I do\n\n\nand\n\n\nI love that exhausted\n\n\nupstairs\n\n\nand i love the higher red line here that\nyou do get with the FAA 20 it's not much\n\n\nbut you gonna come on your extra fee and\nwhich actually makes me\n\n\nyou would think that if you're really\nbanging -\n\n\nyears and\n\n\nit's fine\n\n\nmy water four doors all drive this is\ncertainly when I would be driving still\n\n\nok let me know your thoughts\n\n\nRex here thank you guys very much for\nwatching huge thanks to chris once again\n\n\nfor lamb to review his baby here and as\nyou guys next time take care",
