With its rugged 7.5-inch rubber tires, this infrared grill\/cooler combo is ready to conquer parking lots, campgrounds, sandy beaches...you name it. Once you reach your destination, fire up the infrared grill and get ready for especially juicy burgers and brats. That's because infrared's high heat sears your foods, adding an entirely new dimension of flavor. And if you're feeling thirsty, look beneath the grill and you'll find two removable 30-quart coolers. Packing it up is easy too. Just fold up the side shelves, extend the carrying handle and away you go. Simply put, it's an outdoor adventurer's best friend. \n\nFor more information, visit www.charbroil.com"
