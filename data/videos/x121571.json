Guest cabanas are laid out around the pool and if you are the lucky owner, your suite is inside a volcano.\n\nA waterfall flows from the volcano into the swimming pool. Inside, there's a fully equipped spa, library, gym, spa, cinema, game room and multiple lounges. \n\nWant to get closer to water? A deployable beach deck gives you ocean access for various water activities or lounging around in a different setting.\n\nAnd if you don't want to leave your helicopter behind or flying a guest over, the deck at the rear end can be used as a helicopter landing pad.\n\nSo what do you think? Is this close to a dream yacht? What else would you want in your perfect yacht?"
