Made using an average of 13 recycled plastic bottles per kit, shorts are made with 100% recycled polyester, while jerseys are made with at least 96% recycled polyester. Since 2010, Nike Football has used an estimated 115 million recycled plastic bottles to create its high performance kits.  Lined up end-to-end, that's enough bottles to stretch more than halfway around the world.\n\nWearing the traditional oranje of the Dutch National Team is Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, a prolific striker known for his scoring ability and incredible technical control.\n \nWatch to see how 13 plastic bottles become the most advanced football kit on the planet.  \n\nSubtitles available by clicking on the 'cc' button under the play bar.\n\nFollow Nike Better World: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.nikebetterworld.com\/\u2028\nhttp:\/\/www.twitter.com\/nikebetterworld\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nikebetterworld \u2028\nHashtags: #betterworld #nikefootball",
