Fly with kelp gulls as they study the hunting behavior of the greatest underwater predator of all: the great white shark. Circle with vultures high above the Serengeti as they watch the drama of the wildebeest migration below, and discover what happens when this canny scavenger suddenly becomes prey. Among toxic soda lakes, find out what it is like to be a flamingo, vulnerable to every predator on the continent, including baboons and hyenas. This is Africa as never seen before - from the wings of birds."
