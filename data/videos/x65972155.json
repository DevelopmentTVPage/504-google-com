    "description": "As surfers, Leila Hurst, Camille Brady, and I spend a ton of time in the water, but when we're on dry land we fully devote our time to healthy lifestyles. In this episode, we head to Hanalei Yoga on Kauai to focus on muscle relaxation, core strength, and balance. Then it's a special visit to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu teacher Bruno Ewald to learn some self defense moves.\n\nGet up close and personal with behind the scenes footage from Season 1 of Surfer Girl with my Reflections series on Network A! https:\/\/youtu.be\/tHGD13zFqwM\n\nLike on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlanaBlanchardFanPage\nFollow Alana on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/alanaRblanchard\nFollow Alana on Instagram: https:\/\/instagram.com\/alanarblanchard",
